// This element describes the instrument used to capture the Image. It is
// primarily a container for manufacturer's model and catalog numbers for the
// Microscope, LightSource, Detector, Objective and Filters components. The
// Objective element contains the additional elements LensNA and Magnification.
// The Filters element can be composed either of separate excitation, emission
// filters and a dichroic mirror or a single filter set. Within the Image
// itself, a reference is made to this one Filter element. There may be multiple
// light sources, detectors, objectives and filters on a microscope. Each of
// these has their own ID attribute, which can be referred to from Channel. It
// is understood that the light path configuration can be different for each
// channel, but cannot be different for each timepoint or each plane of an XYZ
// stack.
