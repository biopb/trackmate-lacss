// power is different Wavelength Range - not a simple value so would require
// multiple attributes or a child element Angle of Projection - this would be
// further affected by the optics used for filtering the naked LED or that
// combine power from multiple devices

// These values are further affected if you over-drive the LED resulting in a

// Another issue is that LED's may not be used directly for illumination but as
// drivers for secondary emissions from doped fiber optics. This would require
// the fiber optics to be modeled.
