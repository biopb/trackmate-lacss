// A description of the microscope's objective lens. Required elements include
// the lens numerical aperture, and the magnification, both of which a floating
// point (real) numbers.
//
// The values are those that are fixed for a particular objective: either
// because it has been manufactured to this specification or the value has been
// measured on this particular objective.
//
// Correction: This is the type of correction coating applied to this lens.
// Immersion: This is the types of immersion medium the lens is designed to work
// with. It is not the same as 'Medium' in ObjectiveRef (a single type) as here
// Immersion can have compound values like 'Multi'. LensNA: The numerical
// aperture of the lens (as a float) NominalMagnification: The specified
// magnification e.g. x10 CalibratedMagnification: The measured magnification
// e.g. x10.3 WorkingDistance: WorkingDistance of the lens.
